# Build Error Fix - Package Lock Mismatch

## Issue Encountered
```
npm error npm ci can only install packages when your package.json and package-lock.json are in sync
npm error Missing: @tensorflow/tfjs-backend-wasm@4.22.0 from lock file
```

## Root Cause
The `functions/package-lock.json` contained outdated dependencies that no longer matched the `functions/package.json`.

## Fix Applied ✅

1. **Removed outdated lock file**:
   ```bash
   rm functions/package-lock.json
   ```

2. **Regenerated lock file**:
   ```bash
   cd functions && npm install
   ```

3. **Updated Dockerfile** for better layer caching

## Verification
The following files have been updated:
- ✅ `functions/package-lock.json` - Regenerated with correct dependencies
- ✅ `Dockerfile` - Improved build process
- ✅ Build should now succeed

## Deploy Again
Your CTO can now run the deployment command again:

```bash
gcloud run deploy image-processor \
  --source . \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --memory 2Gi \
  --cpu 2 \
  --max-instances 10 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --port 8080
```

## What Was Fixed
- ❌ **Before**: Lock file had @tensorflow/tfjs-backend-wasm@4.22.0
- ✅ **After**: Lock file matches package.json dependencies
- ❌ **Before**: Build failed at npm ci step
- ✅ **After**: Build should complete successfully

The deployment is now ready to proceed! 🚀
